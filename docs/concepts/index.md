# Core Concepts

LibEntity is built around several core concepts that work together to help you build robust, maintainable business logic. This section covers each concept in detail:

## [Entities](/concepts/entities)
The fundamental building blocks that represent your business objects with their fields, states, and actions.

## [Fields](/concepts/fields)
Properties that hold your entity's data, with built-in validation and type safety.

## [Actions](/concepts/actions)
Operations that can be performed on entities, encapsulating business logic and state transitions.

## [Filters](/concepts/filters)
You can generate filters automatically or by hand to speed up your development with production grade dynamic filter structure.
